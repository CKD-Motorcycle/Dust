#+TITLE: Notes on Dust4go

* State
** Crypto primitives
No viable Skein-256-256 has been verified present yet, so that [[id:ed97541b-2413-4568-8b83-53709baa6715][still needs to be pulled in]] or else written
locally.  Curve25519 is in, along with its Elligator form (using [[https://github.com/agl/ed25519/tree/master/extra25519][agl's extra25519]]) but could use test vectors.
HMAC is using Go's native HMAC mechanism.

The SecretBytes API is a little wonky given Go's memory and execution model, and is mostly voodoo.  Possibly
it should be taken out entirely.

** Crypto/framing layer
Most of this should probably work now, modulo the stubbed-out crypto primitives, but it hasn't been tested
against anything else yet and needs another verification pass.

** Shaping layer
This currently uses a very raw, primitive isochronous pseudo-model.  Real models are on their way once the API
is fixed up.  Loopback communication has successfully been established with the pseudo-model.

** Test proxy
This mostly seems to work, protocol-wise.

There's some wonkiness surrounding the composition of goroutines somewhere in here; it's not clear whether
it's here or in the shaping layer, but the symptom is ungraceful exits or maybe deadlock when the connection
goes away.

** Key tool
This mostly works but should have a cleaner CLI.

* Tasks
** TODO Pull in actual Skein

"Where's the Skein"?

  - https://github.com/dchest/skein only does Skein-512, but the Dust protocol specifies Skein-256-256.
  - https://github.com/wernerd/Skein3Fish is GPLv3 which is probably unusable here.
  - https://github.com/tildeleb/hashland is MIT and supposedly has a Skein-256, but there's some ambiguity
    surrounding the "Make sure licensing and author information is accurate" in the README.

** TODO Pull in actual models
This seems like it might actually need an API discussion first.

** TODO Better CLI for key tool
** TODO Better CLI for test proxy

Put your model files in src/dust/models/.
You cannot build without model files.
You must provide your own model files!

Run ./build.sh, which does the following:

# Install dist library (included in repo)
go build dist
go install dist

# Generate a custom Dust library for your models
go generate Dust

# Install your custom Dust library
go build Dust
go install Dust
go test Dust
